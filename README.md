# Banglore_House_Price_Prediction

Data Preprocessing and Model Building:
Data Collection & Cleaning: Acquire the Bangalore house price dataset from Kaggle and perform necessary data cleaning steps (handling missing values, outliers, etc.).
Feature Engineering: Transform or engineer features to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
Model Training: Train your chosen machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) using the cleaned dataset.

Flask API Development:
Setup Flask Application: Initialize a Flask application.
Load Trained Model: Load the trained machine learning model into your Flask app.
Create API Endpoint(s):
Define routes/endpoints to handle incoming requests (e.g., '/predict_home_price or /get_location_names').
Implement logic to receive input parameters (house features) via POST or GET requests.
Process the received data and pass it to the loaded model for prediction.
Return the predicted house price as a response to the client.


Frontend Integration:
Frontend Development: Create a user interface for your website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Connect to Flask API: Use JavaScript (e.g., Fetch API) to send HTTP requests to the Flask API endpoint from the frontend.
Display Predictions: Receive the predicted house price from the API and display it on the website's user interface.
